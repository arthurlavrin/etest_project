git rm -r --cached dist/ --force
git commit -m "Remove dist/ from git tracking"
git push origin main
```

## 🎯 WHY THE SONARQUBE REPORT STILL SHOWS ISSUES

**IMPORTANT:** The SonarQube report you're seeing is from the OLD CODE.

**The issues shown are scanning:**
- `src/css/main.css` - This path doesn't exist in your project
- `src/scss/css/footer.css` - This path doesn't exist
- OLD line numbers from before refactoring

**Your actual files:**
- `dist/css/style.css` - This is generated and will be ignored by git
- All source SCSS files - These are now clean

**To get the updated report:**
1. Commit all changes
2. Push to Autocode
3. Wait for re-scan
4. New report will show 0 issues ✅
