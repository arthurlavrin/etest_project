# 🔧 Autocode Build Error - FIXED

## ❌ Original Error

```
npm error Missing script: "build"
```

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The automated grading system (Autocode) expects a `build` script in `package.json`. 

**Added:**
```json
"build": "sass src/scss/main.scss dist/css/style.css"
```

This script compiles your SCSS to CSS, which is required for the automated tests to run your project.

## ✅ Verification

```bash
npm run build
# ✅ Compiles successfully
```

## 📝 Updated Files

1. **`package.json`** - Added `"build"` script
2. **`README.md`** - Documented the new build script

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Commit and Push Changes

```bash
# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit with message
git commit -m "Add build script for automated grading system"

# Push to remote
git push origin main
```

### 2. Resubmit to Autocode

The automated system will now:
1. ✅ Run `npm install` (install dependencies)
2. ✅ Run `npm run build` (compile SCSS) ← **This will now work!**
3. ✅ Run tests and grading

## ✅ All Scripts Available

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `npm run build` | **Production build** (for automated grading) |
| `npm run sass-compile` | Manual SCSS compilation |
| `npm run sass-watch` | Watch mode for development |
| `npm run lint` | Check code quality |
| `npm run lint:fix` | Auto-fix code quality issues |

**Status:** ✅ Ready to push and resubmit!
